These costs are usually paid by credit card or cash at the destination briefing. Airport staff are friendly and can assist if needed. Fueling abroad is charged against the club's hourly rate – however, credit cards tucked away in aircraft manuals might not be ideal. It's advisable to carry cash as a precaution and retain the fuel receipt – you can get reimbursed for the fuel invoice upon returning home by submitting a free-form application in the flight preparation area with your bank account number attached with the fuel receipt."
